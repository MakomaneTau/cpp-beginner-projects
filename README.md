# This repository conatains personal c++ projects. With the purpose of mastering c++ programming language

## 1. Area of Shapee C++ calculator

1. The program presents a menu to the user, asking them to select a shape.
2. If the user chooses option 11, it provides more advance 2d shapes in a submenu.
3. Based on the user's selection, the program requires for dimensions of shapes and calculates the area of the chosen shape.
4. The code uses the switch statement to handle different shape options and their corresponding calculations.
5. It utilizes mathematical formulas for calculating areas, including trigonometric functions like tan and sin, as well as constants like M_PI for pi.

## 2. Random password generator

### This C++ program generates a random password of a specified length using characters from the ASCII character set.
<ul>
  <li>It creates a vector keyboardCharacters to store characters from ASCII code 33 to 122 (excluding 123).</li>
  <li>The characters are then shuffled using random_shuffle to create a more random distribution.</li>
  <li>The program prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password, ensuring that the input is valid (an integer between 8 and 20).</li>
  <li>It uses a random number generator to select characters from the shuffled vector and prints the generated password.</li>
  
</ul>
